## 👋 Hi there, I'm @phoozies!

I'm early in my journey as a **Software Engineer**! I'm always excited to build meaningful and fun projects.  
I've developed multiple projects for school and hackathons — here are a few I'm proud of:

- 🚀 [TechReady](https://github.com/Loganaan/techready): A website for helping students get ready and prepped for both technical and behavioural interviews.
- ☄️ [NASA Meteor Madness](https://github.com/phoozies/nasa-meteor-madness): A simulation website built for NASA 2025 Space Apps hackathon.
