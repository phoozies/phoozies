## 👋 Hi there, I'm Thinh Vo!

I'm early in my journey as a **Software Engineer**! I'm always excited to build new and fun projects.
I've developed multiple projects for school and hackathons; here are a few I'm proud of:

- 🚀 [TechReady](https://github.com/Loganaan/techready): A website for helping students get ready for both technical and behavioural interviews.
- ☄️ [NASA Meteor Madness](https://github.com/phoozies/nasa-meteor-madness): A website built to simulate meteor impacts for NASA 2025 Space Apps Challenge hackathon.
